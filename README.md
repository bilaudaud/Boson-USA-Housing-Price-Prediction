# Linear Regression with Python

Your neighbor is a real estate agent and wants some help predicting prices of houses in Boson, USA. It would be great if you could somehow create a model for her that allows her to put in a few features of a house and returns back an estimate of what the house would sell for.

She has asked you if you could help her out with your new data science skills. You say yes, and decide that Linear Regression might be a good path to solve this problem!

Your neighbor then gives you some information about a bunch of houses in regions of the United States,it is all in the data set: USA_Housing.csv.

The data contains the following columns:

* 'Avg. Area Income': Avg. Income of residents of the city house is located in.

* 'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Avg Number of Rooms for Houses in same city
* 'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Avg Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city
* 'Area Population': Population of city house is located in
